NRT stats tests using NRTManagedTestType.

Each test launches a single-thread kernel that exercises a specific
incref/decref code path and then asserts that:

1. NRT allocation stats are balanced (alloc == free, mi_alloc == mi_free).
2. The refcount at key points inside the kernel matches expectations
   (via ``nrt_get_refcount``).

Refcount assertions catch missing-incref bugs (premature frees) that
stats alone cannot detect -- see ``test_device_func_arg_noinline`` for
a detailed explanation.

        scope-exit decref frees the object while the kernel still
        holds a live reference -> the kernel's final decref is a
        use-after-free.

        The child deliberately aliases its argument (``y = obj``) so
        that its scope exit has two decrefs.  Combined with the
        missing arg-binding incref the refcount goes:

            alloc -> 1   (make obj)

        Important caveat: the stats-based assertion (free == alloc)
        alone does NOT catch this bug.  NRT_decref on already-freed
        memory reads a stale refcount and doesn't bump the free
        counter a second time, so stats still show alloc=1, free=1
        even when the bug is present.

            compute-sanitizer --tool memcheck pytest <this file> \\
                -k test_device_func_arg_noinline

        Without the incref in ``lower_arg_assign`` this produces:

        ``inline="always"`` the child is inlined into the kernel,
        the arg-binding IR disappears, and the var-copy incref on
        ``y = obj`` is sufficient.
